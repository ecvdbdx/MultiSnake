# Drawing the elements on the screen

## Ho do we draw things ?

We will draw the different elements in a canvas using Canvas2d.

## What are the different elements we need to draw ?

* Snake
    * Head element
    * Body element
* Apples
* (PowerUps or PowerDowns)

## How we will display things

Each users starts with a Snake head element and one body element. The head element will be represented by a triangle and the body element by a square/rectangle. Each player will have its own color.

Apples will appear randomly on the screen, they will have a very simple form at the beginning (a circle).

Once a player goes over an Apple the snake will become bigger by adding a body element to the end of the snake.
